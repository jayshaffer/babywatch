# Babywatch

Babywatch is an infant monitor to track feeding times for your baby

## Setup

Clone the repo, bundle install and run.

## Usage

The feeding tracker works in intervals of 2 hours. 

When you feed your little drain on society, click the add button and the displaywill give you the next estimated feeding time. 

The app was designed to work with a raspberry pi and a 3.5 inch touch LCD screen so the resolution might be a little off on larger displays
